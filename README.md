MrChromebox firmware utils for NixOS
====================================

Do not report issues to the upstream when running this to update
your system.

## Usage

Read the Nix expression, understand it, run the script, knowing that
this is unsupported by either the author of the expression, or the
author of the firmware.

Run the output as root.

## Updates

Whenever I notice them and get around to it. Contributions welcome.

***Seriously*** do not report issues to the upstream when running
this to update your system.

This may render your system unbootable. Good luck.
